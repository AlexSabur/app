Spiral is an open-source (MIT) micro-framework core that uses a set of open-source components and [an application server](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner) which is designed to rapidly develop (RAD) high-performance PHP-applications that come with native support for HTTP/2, [GRPC](https://grpc.io/), distributed computations ([Queue](https://github.com/spiral/jobs)) and Golang extensions.
